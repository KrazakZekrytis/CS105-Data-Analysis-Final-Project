CS105 Final Project: Data Anaylsis of Genshin Impact

Genshin Impact is a game that was released in September 2020. After it's release, it's popularity skyrocketed to more than millions of players.
This is mostly do the unique characters released every month by the developers. In this project, I will be obtaining the data from API and websites,
cleaning the data, exploring and analyzing data, and developing machine learning models to predict the next character to be released.
